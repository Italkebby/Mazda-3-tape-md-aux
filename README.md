# Mazda-3-tape-md-aux
Trying to achieve aux on my car, with bluetooth connection... I don't know what will happen.
Dislaimer: I don't assume any responsabilities about all this stuff

By the way I'm going to summarize down here all info I found:

First I found a discussion on rx8club.com [link](https://www.rx8club.com/members/willlies-113834/) about developing a system DIY (check [Thank all of y'all](Thanks%20to%20and%20start%20point.png) )
So I get the code (in Aux_1_1 and I modify a delay from 1700 to 1750).

Then I decided to draw a schema about all the parts and how to connect each others.
